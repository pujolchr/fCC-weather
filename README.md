##Show the Local Weather 

 - [X] Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
 - [X] Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
 - [X] Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
 - [X] User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
 - [X] User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
 - [X] User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
 - [X] Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, you will need to choose one of two paths to complete this project:

    * Use HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the Dark Sky API which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.

Or:

    * Use an Internet Protocol API to get user location (ex. IP-API) and then use the OpenWeatherMap API for the weather. Be sure to connect to CodePen.io via http://.
 - [X] Either weather API service will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
 - [X] Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
 - [X] When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
 - [X] You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
